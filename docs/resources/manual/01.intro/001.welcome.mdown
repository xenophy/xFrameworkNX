This page lets you create HTML by entering text in a simple format that's easy to read and write.

  - Type Markdown text in the left window
  - See the HTML in the right

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site] [1]:

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's

This document is written in Markdown; you can see the plain-text version on the left.  To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.  You can see a Markdown syntax guide by switching the right-hand window from *Preview* to *Syntax Guide*.

Showdown is a Javascript port of Markdown.  You can get the full [source code] by clicking on the version number at the bottom of the page.
