<h2>Using this tool</h2>

<p>This page lets you create HTML by entering text in a simple format that's easy to read and write.</p>

<ul>
<li>Type Markdown text in the left window</li>
<li>See the HTML in the right</li>
</ul>

<p>Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the <a href="1">Markdown site</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The overriding design goal for Markdown's
  formatting syntax is to make it as readable 
  as possible. The idea is that a
  Markdown-formatted document should be
  publishable as-is, as plain text, without
  looking like it's been marked up with tags
  or formatting instructions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This document is written in Markdown; you can see the plain-text version on the left.  To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.  You can see a Markdown syntax guide by switching the right-hand window from <em>Preview</em> to <em>Syntax Guide</em>.</p>

<p>Showdown is a Javascript port of Markdown.  You can get the full [source code] by clicking on the version number at the bottom of the page.</p>
